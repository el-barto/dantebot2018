# Dante Bot 2018
Very basic Twitter bot developed for #Dante2018. It tweets a
stanza of the current day's canto from Dante Alighieri's *Divina Commedia*
in Italian at a random interval of time between 30 minutes and 3 hours.

**Update: Jan 9, 2018:** Now, DanteBot2018 also tweets illustrations of the
current day's canto by Gustave Doré.
