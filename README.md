# Dante Bot 2018
Very basic Twitter bot developed for #Dante2018. It tweets a
stanza of the current day's canto from Dante Alighieri's *Divina Commedia*
in Italian at a random interval of time between 30 minutes and 3 hours.

You can follow [@DanteBot2018](https://twitter.com/DanteBot2018) on Twitter.

For bug reports, please use the [issues section](https://github.com/el-barto/dantebot2018/issues).
If you have any suggestions you can tweet to me at [@andresgattinoni](https://twitter.com/andresgattinoni).

**Update: Jan 9, 2018:** Now, DanteBot2018 also tweets illustrations of the
current day's canto. These include the famous engravings by Gustave Doré, images
from the Yates Thompson 36 manuscript and drawings by Sandro Botticelli,
Alessandro Vellutello and John Flaxman.

**Update: Jan 14, 2018:** DanteBot2018 will retweet each day
[@autodante](https://twitter.com/autodante)'s tweet of the current day's canto.

**Update: Apr 12, 2018:** After April 10th (the end of #Dante2018), DanteBot2018 
will retweet highlights (past tweets with at least one fav or RT).
